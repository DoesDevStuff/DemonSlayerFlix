# Mandoflix
Mandoflix is a frontend Netflix clone but This Mandolorian-fied. It is built with React JS and uses the TMDB API to pull in data and images.

# Introduction
This is a practice project to brush up on my skills in creating a react application and deploying it with AWS. 

## The basics :
To create the skeleton of the react-app here are the commands to use (assuming you have node modules installed and up to date) :
1. npx create-react-app <your-app-name>   // This will load all the modules you will need
2. cd <your-app-name>
3. npm start
